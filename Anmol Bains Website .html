    <h3> Highschool</h3>
    <P> For highschool i went to NACI <I> North Albion Collegiate Institiute </I> from 2016 to 2020. Although part of my last year in highschool was done remotely, I made the most of the learning experience and grew as a person. I focused on classes such as 
        <ul> Functions</ul>
        <ul> Advanced functions</ul> 
        <ul> Calculus</ul> 
        <ul> Law</ul>

        1. ITM 200
        2. ITM 500 
        3. ITM 445 
        4. Law 112  
    </B>
           
        I feel as though the ITM courses provided me with useful skills and knowledge that i have applied to real life applications either in my career or personal projects. </P>

<P>Outside of school, I currently work in sales part time as an Account manager. I will return to full time once i graduate this May.I am also a huge fan of workingout and looking after my health. I workout 4 times a week and a day deicated to cardio. In my humble opinion, i am a member of the 
    best gym in the world because of the equipment avalible as well as the bond and comradery among the community. Link the best gym in the world : <a>https://fitness365.ca/</a>
